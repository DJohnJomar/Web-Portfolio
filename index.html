            <h2>Hi, I'm John Jomar</h2>
            <p>I’m a soon-to-be Computer Science graduate who enjoys solving problems through code, giving life to designs, and building systems that work under the hood. While I started with full-stack development, I’ve grown especially interested in the logic, structure, and functionality behind the scenes.</p>
