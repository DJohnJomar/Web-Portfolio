# Jomar's Web Development Portfolio
Welcome to one of my first web development projects! This portfolio showcases several aspects about me: who I am, my ambitions, my projects, academic achievements, and how to get in touch.

Currently, this portfolio is in its raw and early stages. I plan to enhance it as I continue my programming journey, improving it step by step as I gain more knowledge and skills.
